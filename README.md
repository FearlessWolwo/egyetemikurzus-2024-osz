# Matrix Calculator

A simple matrix calculator proof of concept.

## Notes regarding the project

- My plans weren't detailed enough and the project turned out worse than I was expecting. It even has less functionality than what was planned.
- The Tokenizer's main idea came from Jack Vanlightly's amazing blog post called Creating a Simple Tokenizer (Check it out!). The implementation was done in C# (unfortunately for me) and therefore most of the source code stuck in my head and my implementation turned out about 95% equivalent.
- The code quality is not so great...

## Future plans

- Fix code quality or rewrite the project from 0 with more detailed plans.
- Implementation with Abstract Syntax Tree instead of Reverse Polish Notation.
- Maybe take it a step further and implement a scripting language
